#  description: "Mainly mathematical sciences, but also the study of alchemy and biblical chronology. I generalized the binomial theorem to allow real exponents other than nonnegative integers. Also devised a method for finding successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function, it's called ``Newton's method''"
